# React CV App

This is my CV app, that I use to keep my resume and current projects

### Using This For Yourself ###
If you want to use this for yourself, feel free.
The data structure found in <This File> can be changed to your details, and the github address in the github actions file.
You will then set up Github Pages in the usual way. Merging to main should then give you automated deployment and an autoupdating CV github.io website.
