# React CV App

![pages](https://github.com/saminahbab/resume/actions/workflows/cd.yaml/badge.svg)


This is my CV app, that I use to keep my resume and an updated view of my current projects.

It is a simple react app, using the Tailwind framework.


### Using This For Yourself ###

If you want to use this for yourself, feel free.
The data structure found in [this file](./src/components/resume.jsx) can be changed to your details, and the `homepage` key in the [package file](package.json) should be changed to your github address.

You can then set up Github Pages in the usual way. Merging to main should then give you automated deployment and an autoupdating CV github.io website.
